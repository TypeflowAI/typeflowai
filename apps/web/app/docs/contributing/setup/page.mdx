# Setup Dev Environment

## Requirements

To get the project running locally on your machine you need to have the following development tools installed:

- Node.JS (we recommend v20)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

1. Clone the project & move into the directory:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Git clone TypeflowAI monorepo">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TypeflowAI/typeflowai && cd typeflowai
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

2. Install Node.JS packages via pnpm. Don't have pnpm? Get it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Install dependencies via pnpm">

```bash
pnpm install
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`. It's already preset to work with the local development setup but you can also change values if needed.

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Define environment variables">

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

4. Generate & set some secret values mandatory for the ENCRYPTION_KEY & NEXTAUTH_SECRET in the .env file. You can use the following command to generate the random string of required length:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Set value of ENCRYPTION_KEY">

```bash
sed -i '/^ENCRYPTION_KEY=/c\ENCRYPTION_KEY='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
sed -i '/^NEXTAUTH_SECRET=/c\NEXTAUTH_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Deploy Prisma Schema to your Database

1. You'll need to configure your .env file with your database string connection url. You'll need to set the following environment variable in your .env file:
- DATABASE_URL

2. After configuring your .env file with your database string connection url, deploy the Prisma schema to set up your database running:
<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Deploy Prisma Schema">
```bash   
   pnpm run db:migrate:dev
```
  </CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Build

To build all apps and packages and check for build errors, run the following command:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Build TypeflowAI stack">

```bash
pnpm build
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Run Environment

To run the environment, run the following command:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Start TypeflowAI Dev Setup">

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>
   This starts the TypeflowAI main app (plus all its dependencies) as well as the following services:

- Landing Page at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- TypeflowAI Dashboard on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will be automatically redirected to the login. To use your local installation of typeflowai, create a new account.

<Note>
  A fresh setup does not have a default account. Please create a new account and proceed accordingly.
