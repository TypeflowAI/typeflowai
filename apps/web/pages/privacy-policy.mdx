## **Introduction**

We take your data privacy serious. It is our highest priority to offer a privacy-first solution, both self-hosted and in our managed cloud. We take on considerable additional effort to collect as little data as neccessary and handle it safely and securely.

This Privacy Policy explains how and why our organization collects personal data and how it is used. If you have any questions after reading this Privacy Policy, feel free to contact us at **support@typeflowai.com**

### Important Notice

This Privacy Policy only applies to the TypeflowAI Cloud under [https://dashboard.typeflowai.com](https://dashboard.typeflowai.com) (‚ÄùCloud‚Äù) and our Landing Page under typeflowai.com. (‚ÄùLanding Page‚Äù) If you are self-hosting our open source tool on your own servers, this Privacy Policy does not apply.

### Definitions

To avoid confusion, let‚Äôs define who we collect data from:

- Researcher: the person who uses the Cloud to create and distribute TypeflowAI forms and workflows or manage submissions from other forms
- Website visitors: People who visit our marketing landing page

### We are data processor, you are data controller

With our Cloud we are a provider of this Service. We are not the owner of the collected personal data from workflow respondents. The Researcher (the person who sends out a form i.e. you) is responsible for the data they collect and thus data controller of respondent data.

## **Data do we collect**

This is the information we collect from **Website visitors** and **Researchers** as long as you are using our Service:

- **Electronical identification data**: including anonymized IP address, device & browser data;
- **Anonymized information about your use of our website**: including how you end up on our website, what actions you perform and the pages you visited.
- **Registration information:**
  When you register for an account, we collect your name, username, hashed password and email address.
- **Billing information:**
  If you pay for TypeflowAI, we will ask for your billing details including name, address and financial information depending on your payment method (stored by our payment service provider Stripe)
- **Workflow data:**
  We store your workflow data (questions and responses) for you and provide tools for you to analyse and use this data.
- **Error logs:**
  We collect error logs to help us diagnose and fix issues with our service.

## **How we use your data**

TypeflowAI does not sell personal data to third parties. Generally, we only collect your data with your consent in order to:

## **Retention of Data**

We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.

## **Data Subprocessors**

We only share your information with our Service providers who help us operate our business, in which case those third parties are also required to comply with the GDPR framework. We worked hard to reduce the number of subprocessors to a minimum and keep your information. This is a list of the subprocessors we are working with:

## **Data retention**

If you are a TypeflowAI Researcher we do not delete the data in your account. You can delete data in your TypeflowAI account. You are responsible for the time period for which you store the data.

If you are a Respondent, you will need to ask the Researcher how long your responses will be stored in TypeflowAI.

All form data which has been deleted by the form Researcher is permanently deleted from our back-ups within 90 days.

## **Researcher's data protection rights**

TypeflowAI Researchers can exercise their rights directly with us.

If you‚Äôve submitted your personal data through a TypeflowAI form, the Researcher who created the form is responsible for the collected data. TypeflowAI only processes the data. Respondents should contact the person or organization which created the form. If this isn't possible, please contact us. We'll help in any way we can.
