If you don’t know what your business's value proposition is, you don’t have a business. It's as clear as that, because you don’t know what problem your service or product solves. 

That’s why it’s so important to know how to define a unique value proposition and, above all, how to communicate it clearly to your leads and customers.

But what is a unique value proposition, really? 

It’s the main competitive advantage your business has. Or in other words: it’s a phrase or paragraph that expresses why customers should buy from you and not your competition.

Now, what’s the problem? Summarizing your unique value proposition in a few words is a complex process that takes time: it requires prior market research, competitor analysis, understanding of the buyer personas you’re targeting, and the products and services you offer (as well as their benefits).

Moreover, you have to synthesize all this information into a single sentence so that when you communicate it to your leads and customers on your website or in an ad, for example, it’s clear upon reading.

Fortunately, we have two very powerful tools:

1) Pre-formulated methods by business schools like Harvard Business School (HBS) or by renowned professionals like Geoff Moore or Steve Blank.

2) AI-powered tools like TypeflowAI. What if we combined these two sources of knowledge? You’d have the perfect unique value proposition.

Let's see an example:

Imagine you sell specialty coffee and you want to reflect the value you offer to your customers. In this case, you could use a form to answer these questions:

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

- What type of business do you want to generate a unique value proposition for?
- What problem does your product solve?
- In which industry?
- What is the predominant age of your customers?
- What is the predominant gender of your customers?
- In what city or country are your customers primarily located?
- What products or services do you offer?
- What are the main benefits of your product or service?
- What are the main features of your product or service?

</UseCaseCallout>

TypeflowAI would use the answers (which would take you no more than 1 minute to complete) to generate an advanced prompt that would produce 3 examples of unique value propositions using the mentioned formulas. 

Thus, it would offer you a result like this:

<UseCaseCallout title="Result" type="result">
