    "Use AI to write video scripts like a copywriter by answering 3 questions. Generate video scripts for your marketing videos, social media videos, and more.",
};

Until now, if you wanted to promote your products or services by making a video, you had to hire a marketing agency (or work with your own marketing department) to create the video scriptâ€¦ 

That means you need a copywriter, a voice-over artist, video recording and editing staff... and, of course, a marketing expert to lead the entire project.

But artificial intelligence has come to revolutionize absolutely all professions, and what used to take hours or days, now takes hours or minutes. Moreover, a tool has emerged that makes the process even easier and can exponentially increase your productivity: TypeflowAI.

TypeflowAI combines the full potential of forms with Artificial Intelligence so you can get results more tailored to your needs... Because, what happens? When you use tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini, you get generic and bland results, but when you actually provide a specific context to the prompt you are going to use, you get true WOW results!

And it's as easy as answering some simple questions on a form that will then be introduced as variables in an advanced prompt, generating an amazing response that will be the envy of the best copywriter.

Let's see it with an example.

Imagine that a company delivering healthy food to homes wants to make a video to promote its services. In that case, they would just need to use TypeflowAI and answer these questions:

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

- What is the name of your company? WeLunch
- What product or service do you sell? Home Delivery Healthy Food
- What problem does it solve? Lack of time for cooking
- What are the 3 main benefits of your product or service? Eat Healthy, avoid last-minute shopping, avoid calorie count.
- What is your website? www.welunch.org

And, in a few minutes, a prompt would execute that would yield a result like this:

<UseCaseCallout title="Result" type="result">
