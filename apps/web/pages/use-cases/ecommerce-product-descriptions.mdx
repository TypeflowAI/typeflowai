};

Writing product descriptions for an ecommerce site is a time-consuming activity that, to be effective and address key customer objections, requires analysis, reflection, and, of course, writing. 

If, for example, this process takes around 30 minutes (at a minimum) per product and you have a catalog of 100 products, you'd need to dedicate about 50 hours to write all the descriptions, without taking breaks and working tirelessly. 

Not to mention the time it takes to take photos, upload them to the content management system...

But you created an ecommerce to sell, right? 

So, if you can save all that time, all the better, because you'll be able to devote it to more valuable actions, like marketing campaigns, for instance.

What if I told you that now you can do the descriptions in 10% of the time using AI-powered forms from TypeFlowAI?

Confirmed.

It's now possible! 

You just need to set up a series of questions in the form, and the answers will be used in a prompt to generate customized responses for each product.
