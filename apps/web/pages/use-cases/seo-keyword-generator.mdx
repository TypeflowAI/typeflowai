Creating content takes time, but now it can be radically sped up thanks to artificial intelligence. However, this effort is futile if the content doesn't properly rank on major search engines.

Thus, to make your efforts worthwhile, it's crucial to combine content marketing strategy with research on the main keywords you want to rank for.

What's the problem? Conducting research takes time and money (as it often requires paid tools like Semrush, AHREF, etc.)...

But...

What if I told you that now you can do it just by filling out a form? That's what you can do with TypeflowAI, a tool that combines the power of forms with artificial intelligence to produce unique results in minutes, not hours or days.

For example, imagine you're tasked with creating content for the blog of a leading supermarket brand. 

The process would go like this:

- Analyze the competition
- Use tools to find keywords
- Develop content using these keywords in H1, H2, and body text.

However, using TypeflowAI, you'd only have to answer these questions:

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

- What is the name of your business? UK Supermarkets
- What industry do you belong to? Retail
- What is the URL of competitor 1? Tesco
- What is the URL of competitor 2? Waitrose
- What is the URL of competitor 3? Sainsbury's
- What categories of products and services do you offer? Food, beauty, cleaning, etc.

</UseCaseCallout>

And the responses will be used within a prompt to generate a result.

Let's see it with an example:

<UseCaseCallout title="Result" type="result">

After reviewing the websites of Tesco, Waitrose, and Sainsbury's, several key areas and potential supermarket-related keywords were identified that could be valuable for UK Supermarkets. 

Below is a table with examples of keywords, associated content ideas, and an estimate of the ranking difficulty for each:

| Keyword                     | Content Idea                                                             | Ranking Difficulty |
