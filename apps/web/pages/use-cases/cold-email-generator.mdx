    "Master the art of writing cold emails with AI in under 30 seconds to boost your sales opportunities. Effective, concise, and impactful.",
};

Do you know how many commercial emails we receive a day? 

According to this recent study, each person gets an average of 20 to 30 a day... and that's just in the personal sphere, because in the professional realm it can be much more, depending on the industry you work in.

That's why, if you're in sales and need to generate opportunities daily, you know that cold outreach is tough: emails don't even get opened, if they are read they're quickly dismissed; and if you do get a response, most of the time it's a NO.

But, what if I told you that you now have the chance to create emails with catchy subjects and texts that talk about the real problems and needs of your leads in just a few seconds?

This is what you can do with TypeflowAI, a form powered by artificial intelligence that allows you to input, through questions and answers, a series of variables that are then used in a prompt to generate different types of cold emails.
