    "Create adaptive lead magnets with AI, tailored to your audience's preferences. Increase engagement by addressing specific customer needs.",
};

What is every entrepreneur's or marketer dream? To satisfy the specific needs of each and every one of their customers.

Not just those of a target group...

Not just those of a buyer persona representing a typical user...

...but those of every single person who interacts with their business or uses their product.

Until now, this seemed impossible to achieve because no one knew the true needs of each lead or customer.

But all of this has changed thanks to the advent of artificial intelligence, and more specifically, TypeFlowAI.

Why? Because with AI-powered forms, you can set up a series of questions to understand the specific needs that can then be addressed in a highly specific manner.

Let's see an example:

Imagine you're a nutritionist and you want to offer a client a basic weekly plan to start taking care of themselves. In that case, you could ask them to fill out a simple AI form indicating their weight, height, and 3-month goal, and TypeflowAI would generate a personalized result in just seconds, including 3 daily meal ideas and a list of ingredients.

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

You can do it in two ways:

1. Internally, by even filling out the form yourself and then delivering the result to save time.
2. As a dynamic lead magnet that you incorporate on your website to capture emails and then make upsellings.

But you still have more options:

You can take productivity to the highest level by connecting your AI Form with Google Sheets to store your clients' data. You also have the possibility to connect the form with Zapier and send the result to the client or lead through an email.

As you can see, the possibilities are endless!
