    "Learn how to write email subjects that never go unnoticed using AI forms. Use AI to generate email subjects that get more opens and clicks.",
};

The difference between an email that's read and one that isn't is simple: the former has a good subject line, and the latter does not. Why? 

Because no matter how much effort you put into the email content or how interesting your content is or the value your product or service provides, it will all be in vain if no one reads it, don't you think?

That's why it's so important to know about email structures that have shown a high open rate, which is known as "Email open rate".

The good news is that some of the world's best copywriters, like Bob Bly, and the biggest email marketing specialists in the world like Gary Vaynerchuk or Neil Patel, have publicly shared some of their formulas for making their emails open and read.

Can you imagine having a tool that used this knowledge to help you draft your email subjects? 

Now it's possible thanks to TypeflowAI, a tool that combines the potential of forms with artificial intelligence. 

With just a few questions, you can generate a specific context that then becomes a specialized prompt in email subject creation and, as a result, you get subject ideas that could have been written by these specialists...

Would you like to see an example?

Imagine a hosting company offers website creation through artificial intelligence and wants to promote this service to its current customer base by sending a newsletter.

  alt="Email Subject Generator"
  className="rounded-xl max-w-full" 
/>

In this case, they could use an AI Form and answer these questions:

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

- What does your company do? The company offers AI-generated websites
- What is the main benefit of your product, service, or promotion? Speed: a website with texts and images in 2 minutes
- What main problem does your product or service solve? Any business can have a website without knowledge about design, copywriting, or programming
- What is the goal of the email? To introduce the service to the email database.

</UseCaseCallout>

Once answered, the responses would turn into variables to run a prompt that would result in: 5 very effective email subject ideas.

<UseCaseCallout title="Result" type="result">

1.- [Solution to a problem] + [Limited availability]:
"Effortless professional website: Only for the first 50"

2.- Specific benefit:
"Your page ready in 2 minutes: Start now"

3.- Intrigue or mystery:
"We reveal how to easily create your website with AI"

4.- Scarcity or urgency:
"Final opportunity to digitalize your business"

5.- Exclusivity:
"VIP Access: Create your website with AI before anyone else"

</UseCaseCallout >

Thus, the company would only have to choose one of them and start attracting customers for their new service.

Incredible, isn't it? 

And there's more: you can also connect TypeflowAI with Notion, Airtable, Google Docs, or Google Spreadsheet to store these ideas and create an archive of email subjects that you can use in the future.

As you can see, the possibilities are endless!
