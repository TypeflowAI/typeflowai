Offering an excellent customer experience is a key aspect for the proper functioning of a business:

- It helps to retain them and to repeat the experience, thereby increasing the customer lifetime value.
- It boosts competitive advantage over other market players.
- It aids in building a robust and solid business with greater growth capacity.

However, providing a good experience is a complex process that starts with understanding the needs of different buyer personas, defining what actions to take at each stage of the customer journey, how to act on different touchpoints, detecting emotional stages... in short, creating a customer journey map that helps to achieve our goals.

And the problem is that this exercise takes time for research, reflection, and completion, which can extend over a few days or weeks, depending on the case.

But, what if I told you that now you can drastically speed up the process by simply filling out a form? 

This is what you can do with TypeflowAI, a tool that combines forms with the power of artificial intelligence to turn question responses into personalized prompts that generate incredible results.

How? Let's see with an example:

Imagine you want to improve the customer experience of a mobile app where you can book vacation rental homes, and for that, you need to create a customer journey map.

You would just need to answer some simple questions:

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

- What kind of business do you want to generate a customer journey map for? Vacation rental mobile app
- In which industry? Vacation rental
- In which city or country are your customers primarily located? Mexico
- What is the goal of the customer journey map? Increase the number of monthly bookings

</UseCaseCallout>

And TypeflowAI would do the rest: first, it would create a customized buyer persona for this case, and then it would generate a complete customer journey map that includes actions to be taken at each stage of the journey so you can achieve the goal of increasing the number of monthly bookings.
