The buyer persona is one of the best marketing exercises you can perform to understand the profile of the average buyer, including their demographics, psychographics, and even purchasing preferences. 

While it’s not an exercise that represents reality 100%, it can give you a general idea and basic notions to develop:
- Products and services based on their needs.
- Content in which they see themselves represented.

However, creating a well-defined buyer persona takes a lot of time: you have to block off hours in your calendar to research users across different statistical studies, consult websites, YouTube videos, social networks, etc., and generally, any site that provides you with information about this buyer persona.

Moreover, you then have to do all the writing, organizing this information in a structured and orderly manner. And once again, that requires a lot of time we don’t have. Especially when what we want is to validate a business hypothesis or a new product or service idea.

But, what if you could generate a buyer persona in about 30 seconds by answering 2 questions? 

Now you can do it using TypeflowAI, a form powered by AI that allows you to set up a series of questions that, combined with a prompt, result in a specific answer to any need you have, such as creating this buyer persona.
