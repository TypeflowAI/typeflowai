Weighing by difficulty level and success potential:

Among the proposed solutions, developing an online platform offering personalized food products without allergens seems to be the simplest and with the highest potential for success. 

This is due to the increasing awareness of food allergies and intolerances and the demand for customized products to meet specific dietary needs. 

Additionally, this solution can be implemented with a relatively low investment, leveraging existing digital technologies, and has a wide potential market.
