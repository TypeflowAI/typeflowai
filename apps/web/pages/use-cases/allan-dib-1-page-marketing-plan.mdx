};

No one knows what will happen in 1, 2, or 3 years because the current world is characterized as VUCA, meaning it's volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous.

In other words, this means it's a landscape that changes too quickly, and it's difficult to assimilate so many transformations in such a short time, whether it's because new technologies like artificial intelligence, blockchain, or the metaverse appear, or simply because competing in the global market brings new players who put any business model at risk.

Therefore, the question you should ask yourself is, how can a business stand out and be profitable in such a changing context? 

By developing a very clear marketing strategy that's quick to think about and execute. 

How? 

With tools like, for example, the 1-page marketing plan by the renowned marketing specialist Allan Dib or other similar templates that also deliver good results.

Just as long-term business plans (with dozens or hundreds of pages that nobody is going to read) are increasingly used less, and a business model is defined in one page, precisely because this context is too changing, the same happens in the world of marketing where, even more, it is necessary to be ultra concise.

But, what if I told you there is an even faster way to develop a one-page marketing plan?

Now you can do it with TypeflowAI, a tool that combines the power of forms with artificial intelligence. Thus, by answering just two questions, you could generate a complete marketing plan that you could put into practice right at this moment.

Can you imagine the competitive advantage your business could have?

Let's see it with an example:

<Image

  alt="Allan Dib 1 Page Marketing Plan"
  className="rounded-xl max-w-full" 
/>

Imagine that your company sells specialty coffee in London. In the case you wanted to use Allan Dib's template, you would only have to answer two questions:

<UseCaseCallout title="Example questions" type="questions">

- What products or services do you sell? Specialty Coffee
- What is your target market? London

</UseCaseCallout>

And in just 1 minute the answers to these questions would be transformed into an advanced prompt by TypeflowAI that would result in a structured one-page marketing plan like this:
