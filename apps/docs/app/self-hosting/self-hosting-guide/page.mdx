#### Self-Hosting

# Self Hosting TypeflowAI

At TypeflowAI, we understand that different users have different needs, and we strive to cater to a wide variety of situations. This is why we currently provide two ways of running our application:

1. **Local setup**: This method is designed for those who want to run TypeflowAI on their local machine for development or testing purposes. It's perfect for those who want to get a feel for the application, experiment with its features, or contribute to its development. The local setup method requires you to have a few development tools installed on your machine, such as Node.js and pnpm. It also requires you to set up a local database and configure some environment variables. This method is ideal for developers who are comfortable with setting up and configuring development environments.

2. **Remote Setup**: This method is designed for those who want to deploy TypeflowAI on a remote server for production use. It's perfect for those who want to run TypeflowAI as a live application accessible to users over the internet. The remote setup method requires you to have a server with Docker installed. You can deploy TypeflowAI using Docker Compose, which makes it easy to manage the application's containers and dependencies. This method is ideal for system administrators and DevOps engineers who are comfortable with deploying and managing applications on remote servers.

Please note that regardless of the method you choose, TypeflowAI is designed to be easy-to-use and flexible. So choose the method that best fits your comfort level and requirements, and start leveraging the **power of TypeflowAI** today!

## Local Setup

Quickly set up and start using TypeflowAI without getting into the technicalities of the build process.

This is ideal for those who are testing TypeflowAI or want to run it with minimal to no modifications.

### Requirements

To get the project running locally on your machine you need to have the following development tools installed:

- Node.JS (we recommend v20)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

1. Clone the project & move into the directory:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Git clone TypeflowAI monorepo">

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TypeflowAI/typeflowai && cd typeflowai
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

2. Install Node.JS packages via pnpm. Don't have pnpm? Get it [here](https://pnpm.io/installation)

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Install dependencies via pnpm">

```bash
pnpm install
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`. It's already preset to work with the local development setup but you can also change values if needed.

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Define environment variables">

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

4. Generate & set some secret values mandatory for the ENCRYPTION_KEY & NEXTAUTH_SECRET in the .env file. You can use the following command to generate the random string of required length:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Set value of ENCRYPTION_KEY">

```bash
sed -i '/^ENCRYPTION_KEY=/c\ENCRYPTION_KEY='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
sed -i '/^NEXTAUTH_SECRET=/c\NEXTAUTH_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Deploy Prisma Schema to your Database

1. You'll need to configure your .env file with your database string connection url. You'll need to set the following environment variable in your .env file:
- DATABASE_URL

2. After configuring your .env file with your database string connection url, deploy the Prisma schema to set up your database running:
<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Deploy Prisma Schema">
```bash   
   pnpm run db:migrate:dev
```
  </CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Build

To build all apps and packages and check for build errors, run the following command:

<Col>
<CodeGroup title="Build TypeflowAI stack">

```bash
pnpm build
```

</CodeGroup>
</Col>

### Run Environment

To run the environment, run the following command:

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Start TypeflowAI Dev Setup">

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

After starting the environment, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to interact with the TypeflowAI application. The first time you access this page, you'll be greeted by a setup wizard. Follow the prompts to define your first user and get started.

## Remote Setup

Deploying TypeflowAI remotely opens up a range of possibilities, allowing you to run our application on any platform that supports Next.js applications. We highly recommend using Vercel for its seamless compatibility with Next.js projects. Here’s how you can get started with deploying TypeflowAI on Vercel:

### Deploying on Vercel

Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions that fits perfectly with Next.js projects. Follow these steps to deploy your TypeflowAI project:

1. Fork or Clone TypeflowAI Repository: First, ensure you have a copy of the TypeflowAI repository in your GitHub account.

2. Set Up Vercel Account: If you haven't already, sign up for a Vercel account and set up a new project by importing your TypeflowAI repository.

3. Configure Your Project: In your Vercel dashboard, select your imported project and configure it by setting the necessary environment variables that you would usually have in your .env file.

<Col>
   <CodeGroup title="Set up environment variables on Vercel">

```bash
- Add DATABASE_URL with your database connection string.
- Add NEXTAUTH_URL set to your Vercel project domain.
- Add NEXTAUTH_SECRET with a secure random string.
```
   </CodeGroup>
</Col>

4. Deploy: With your environment variables set, deploy your application directly through the Vercel dashboard. Vercel will automatically detect that it’s a Next.js project and configure the build settings for you.

5. Domain Configuration: After your project is deployed, you can configure your custom domain or use the default one provided by Vercel.

<Note>
  The first deployment might take a bit longer due to the build process. Subsequent deployments will be faster thanks to Vercel's cache.
