#### API

# API Overview

TypeflowAI offers two types of APIs: the **Public Client API** and the **Management API**. Each API serves a different purpose, has different authentication requirements, and provides access to different data and settings.

Checkout the [API Key Setup](/docs/api/management/api-key-setup) - to generate, store, or delete API Keys.

## Public Client API

The Public Client API is designed for the JavaScript SDK and does not require authentication. It's primarily used for creating persons, sessions, and responses within the TypeflowAI platform. This API is ideal for client-side interactions, as it doesn't expose sensitive information.

- [Actions API](/docs/api/client/actions) - Create actions for a person
- [Displays API](/docs/api/client/displays) - Mark Workflow as Displayed or Responded for a Person
- [People API](/docs/api/client/people) - Create & update people (e.g. attributes)
- [Responses API](/docs/api/client/responses) - Create & update responses for a workflow

## Management API

The Management API provides access to all data and settings that are visible in the TypeflowAI App. This API requires a personal API Key for authentication, which can be generated in the Settings section of the TypeflowAI App. With the Management API, you can manage your TypeflowAI account programmatically, accessing and modifying data and settings as needed.

**Auth:** Personal API Key

API requests made to the Management API are authorized using a personal API key. This key grants the same rights and access as if you were logged in at typeflowai.com. It's essential to keep your API key secure and not share it with others.

To generate, store, or delete an API key, follow the instructions provided on the following page [API Key](/docs/api/management/api-key-setup).

- [Action Class API](/docs/api/management/action-classes) - Create, Update, and Delete Action Classes
- [Attribute Class API](/docs/api/management/attribute-classes) - Create, Update, and Delete Attribute Classes
- [Me API](/docs/api/management/me) - Retrieve Account Information
- [People API](/docs/api/management/people) - Create, Update, and Delete People
- [Responses API](/docs/api/management/responses) - Create, Update, and Delete Responses
- [Workflows API](/docs/api/management/workflows) - Create, Update, and Delete Workflows
- [Webhook API](/docs/api/management/webhooks) - Create, Update, and Delete Webhooks

<Note>
  By understanding the differences between these two APIs, you can choose the appropriate one for your needs,
  ensuring a secure and efficient integration with the TypeflowAI platform.
