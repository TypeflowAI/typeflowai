#### API

# API Key Setup

## Auth: Personal API key

The API requests are authorized with a personal API key. This API key gives you the same rights as if you were logged in at typeflowai.com - **don't share it around!**

### How to generate an API key

1. Go to your settings on [dashboard.typeflowai.com](https://dashboard.typeflowai.com).
2. Go to page “API keys”
   <MdxImage src={AddApiKey} alt="Add API Key" quality="100" className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl" />
3. Create a key for the development or production environment.
4. Copy the key immediately. You won’t be able to see it again.
   <MdxImage
     src={ApiKeySecret}
     alt="API Key Secret"
     quality="100"
     className="max-w-full rounded-lg sm:max-w-3xl"
   />

<Note>
  ### Store API key safely Anyone who has your API key has full control over your account. For security
  reasons, you cannot view the API key again.
</Note>
